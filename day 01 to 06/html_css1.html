    <h2>Iron Man</h2>
    <p>
      Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
      scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby,
      the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and
      received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his
      creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the
      Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. Iron Man stories,
      individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since
      the character's creation.

      he success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of
      superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero
      characters.[1] During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept
      for Iron Man.[1] Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character
      likeable, saying that he "thought it would be fun to take the kind of
      character that nobody would like, none of [Marvel's] readers would like,
      and shove him down their throats and make them like him"

      When his stories frequently invoked the Cold War during his first years of
      publication, Iron Man stood for liberal capitalism, fighting against
      communism in the name of democracy and capitalism.[88] In the early 1970s,
      Iron Man became more self-doubting, questioning when the use of force is
      justified against communism,[89] and he responded by becoming a
      philanthropist.[90] The 1990s saw Iron Man reject broader ideology in
      favor of individualism, and his allegiance to American democracy was
      replaced by his own personal values.

      Iron Man was more overtly political than other Marvel characters of the
      Silver Age.[97] Stan Lee wished to create the "quintessential capitalist",
      developing him as an industrialist that manufactures weapons to fight
      communism.[98] From 1963 to 1968, Iron Man represented capitalism and the
      United States in allegories for the Cold War
